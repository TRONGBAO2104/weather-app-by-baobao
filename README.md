# WEATHER APP

**Demo App:** https://weather-app-by-baobao.netlify.app/

**Source API call:** https://openweathermap.org/

- **Story:** I used to make this app using HTML&CSS for practice. After learning ReactJS, I thought why not reuse the app to practice ReactJS. So I rebuilt this app by adding React framework

- **Description:**
- User search for city name and app will show city weather information
- If user type wrong city name (eg hanoi2, clf...etc...), app shows "city not found"

- **Responsive web desing:** Multiple screen sizes for Mobile, Tablet, PC
